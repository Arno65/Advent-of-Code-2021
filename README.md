# Advent-of-Code-2021

This repository contains most of my solutions for Advent of Code 2021.
My main programming language is Haskell. I do some work in Swift. And I'm learning bits of Lisp and Rust.

Spoiler alert: All the code has the end results of the tasks in the comment section at the start of the code.
Also notice that these end results are obtained with the puzzle inputs for my Advent-of-Code-2021 account.


Day 1 has solutions in Haskell, (old school) BASIC, clisp, rust and swift.
(The Haskell code has three different solutions for counting the measurement increases.) 

Day 2 has solutions in Haskell, clisp, rust and swift.

For the time being... day 3 has only a Haskell solution.
