# Advent-of-Code-2021

This repository contains most of my solutions for Advent of Code 2021.
My main programming language is Haskell. I do some work in Swift. And I'm learning bits of Lisp and Rust.

Day 1 has solutions in Haskell, (old school) BASIC, clisp, rust and swift.
(The Haskell code has three different solutions for counting the measurement increases.) 

Day 2 has solutions in Haskell, clisp, rust and swift.
